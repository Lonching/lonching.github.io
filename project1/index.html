        <h2>What Are The Zodiac</h2>
        <h3>Elements?</h3>
        <h4>The twelve zodiac signs are grouped into four elements—fire, earth, air and water. 
          Each of these elementary groups has distinct traits. 
          Each one plays a critical role in maintaining our well-being. 
          Together, they form the natural world, so each is in some way dependent on the other.</h4>

        <h2>What are the Earth</h2>
        <h3>Elements?</h3>
        <h4>Earth signs keep it real. They are the “grounded” people on the planet, the ones who bring us down to earth and remind us to start with a solid foundation. 
          Slow and steady, these “builders” are loyal and stable, and stick by their people through their hard times. </h4>

        <h4>Capricorn:</h4>
        <p>Capricorns desire to build a life that has a solid foundation. 
          This most often leads them to become especially hardworking, focused on creating career and financial success. 
          However, they just as equally value strong long-term relationships and a domestic life that also feel like personal achievements. 
          These people are disciplined and determined, but sometimes to the point of austerity.</p>

          <h4>Virgo:</h4>
          <p>Virgos are immensely talented at assessing the details of any situation and finding solutions to problem-solve them. 
          They are natural-born organizers and value consistency, loyalty and productivity. 
          They invest very much of themselves into their goals and plans but can become very critical if things do not develop as they had originally expected.</p>
          
          <h4>Taurus:</h4>
          <p>Tauruses value security and stability above all. They enjoy the finer things in life and are attracted to the full exploration of the senses. 
          They are drawn to beauty and pleasure and invest themselves entirely in what they believe in. These people are especially hard-working and like to take a practical approach to life. 
          This often leads them to be excellent with money and attract it to them like a magnet once they focus their skills and talents.</p>

        <h2>What are the Water</h2>
        <h3>Elements?</h3>
        <h4>Water is about emotions. Water feels. That single word – feeling – covers a lot of bases: joy, sorrow, ennui, ecstasy, good moods, bad moods, 
          and every other emotional state in between them. All of them are in Water’s domain.</h4>

        <h4>Cancer:</h4>
        <p>Cancers often put their hearts fully into anything they believe in. 
          However, represented by the crab, they have a hard shell to crack before you can get to their softest side. 
          These people also tend to be especially nurturing, valuing domesticity and family greatly. 
          Building a stable and safe home is important, as they need a great deal of time to recharge their batteries.</p>

          <h4>Scorpio:</h4>
          <p>Scorpios are “all or nothing” kinds of people. They have a natural ability to enchant others, utilizing their powerful minds 
            and auras to dominate situations and relationships. Deeply emotional, they can brood in the extremes of their feelings. 
            Craving intimacy and psychological depth above all, they navigate the world like a game in order to win and conquer whatever they 
            set their sights upon.</p>
          
          <h4>Pisces:</h4>
          <p>Pisces are often old souls. They have an innate connection to the mystical and spiritual world, often drawn to deeply romantic, 
            creative or transformative experiences. They are especially compassionate and sensitive, often putting the needs of others before 
            themselves. They are excellent friends, enjoying a vivid social life filled with many unique people.</p>

        <h2>What are the Fire</h2>
        <h3>Elements?</h3>
        <h4>Fire keeps us strong enough to bounce back from defeat, disappointment, and the most grievous losses life can throw at us. 
          By “strong enough,” I do not just mean remaining grimly determined. Fire is not about Stoicism, it is about resilience. </h4>

          others would be unable to go. An eternal child at heart, Aries are energetic and aggressive, filled with an enthusiasm for life. 
          They can be quick to anger, but also just as eager to laugh and move on.</p>

          <h4>Leo:</h4>
          <p>Leos love to live life to the fullest. They tend to have an innate confidence and radiance that gives them the ability to 
            easily assert themselves and stand out from the crowd. They often like to be recognized for everything they bring to the world, 
            sometimes to the point of pride or arrogance. Despite this, Leos are extremely loyal, romantic and artistic, called to express 
            the fire inside of them vividly.</p>
          
          <h4>Sagittarius:</h4>
          <p>Sagittarians crave expansion and exploration above all. They refuse to be caged and hunger for everything that life has to offer 
            them. They tend to be sojourners, seeking new ideas, relationships and experiences that will teach them more about themselves and 
            the world.</p>

        <h2>What are the Air</h2>
        <h3>Elements?</h3>
        <h4>Air signs are all about action, ideas, and motion—they are the “winds of change.” When a strong gust hits you, you can’t help 
          but move. While some within their ranks may be true-life “airheads,” others are as powerful as a gravity-defying G-force.</h4>

        <h4>Gemini:</h4>
        <p>Geminis are curious about everything. They take a highly intellectual view of the world, ready to learn about everything and 
          everyone. As master communicators, they are gifted at being flexible and versatile in connecting with others. Represented by 
          the twins, they may have two sides to their personalities, though one they show the world, and one they keep hidden.</p>

          <h4>Libra:</h4>
          <p>Libras value peace and balance above all. They strive for fairness in life and in their relationships. 
            They also have a natural tendency to surround themselves with beauty and luxury. Also, as eternal romantics, 
            they crave relationships and partnerships and will dive into union headfirst when they find someone they admire deeply.</p>
          
          <h4>Aquarius:</h4>
