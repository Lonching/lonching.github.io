        <h3>Elements?</h3>
        <p>The twelve zodiac signs are grouped into four elements—fire, earth, air and water. 
          Each of these elementary groups has distinct traits. 
          Each one plays a critical role in maintaining our well-being. 
          Together, they form the natural world, so each is in some way dependent on the other.</p>
